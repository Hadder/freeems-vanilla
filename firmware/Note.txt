Please note :

If you downloaded the latest zipped release these firmware files are current.

However...

If you are accessing these files via a Git clone from github.com then these
firmware files are not a representation of the current state of the code.
Rather they are the output from the source as it was at the time of the last
release of the code. Please attempt to build the code if you want the latest
at any given time. Beware that "snapshot" code is NOT guaranteed to work.

Also note :

Only the NipponDenso.s19 file is semi functional at this time.

Thank you for your time!
